#### A few thoughts on technical take-home challenges

To be clear that these are **not** coding exercises. The goal of these exercises is to give you, the candidate, an asynchronous medium for demonstrating how you would break down a set of user stories and requirements into something similar to a spike or short duration sprint. These challenges are not graded or scored nor are they pass-fail. Rather these challenges are meant to serve a sample of your reductive thought processes as an engineer.

#### Time frame and instructions

We want to be respectful of your time. We ask that you keep these challenges to *1-2 hours* at most. Remember our goal is to understand how you approach, problem solve and work through the challenge provided, not to build out a full featured application within an hour.

Once completed, schedule a time with us to review your code and present your work.

Checkout the instructions inside each respective for next steps.

Here are some additional benefits to take-home challenges:

* **Time flexibility**: Candidates have the freedom to plan their time and submit their work within the given deadline instead of cramming everything within a limited time frame during the interview.

* **Real-world simulation**: Building a challenge that closely mirrors the candidate's target role is a great way to simulate the duties that would be expected of them in their job

* **Ethical way of applying pressure**: Technical take-home challenges are a more ethical way to achieve it without having to stress a candidate out during an interview.

* **Better performance assessment**: It's easier to give and receive feedback from a candidate on their work if the challenge is taken at home. In this way, this type of test provides a more authentic measure of how well a candidate might actually complete work for the company.

* **Less interview bias**: Candidates from underrepresented backgrounds can perform better in technical assignments than they do in interview settings. Therefore, giving them the option of a technical take-home challenge can diversify your talent pool.
